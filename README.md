# 🎧 DJ BagGuy – Portfolio & Booking Site

This is the official portfolio and booking site for DJ BagGuy — showcasing upcoming events, music mixes, a photo gallery, and a fully functional contact form for event bookings.

---

## 📖 About

This is a professional DJ booking website I made while trying to get better and gain more experience with web design. It was built as a real-world project to sharpen my frontend skills, implement backend form functionality, and create a fully responsive, interactive experience.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React** (via Next.js)
- **Next.js App Router** using `app/` directory
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Resend Email API** for backend email handling
- **Render / Vercel** for deployment

---

## 📬 Email Functionality

The contact/booking form sends booking requests directly to DJ BagGuy’s inbox using the **Resend API**. Inputs are validated before submission to ensure clean and clear inquiries.

> Special thanks to [ByteGrad](https://www.youtube.com/@ByteGrad) on YouTube for their tutorial on setting up Resend with Next.js!
